    "An algorithm is a series of steps to solve a problem at hand\n",
    "\n",
    "• Why is Python considered to be a high-level language?\n",
    "High-level coding languages are more like natural languages.  Python takes less time to write.  It is shorter and easier to read as opposed to binary machine like languages.  It is more likely to be correct and error free when written.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tWhat is the program we use to write Python in?\n",
